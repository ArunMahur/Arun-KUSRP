        ** What is gRPC **  
gRPC is a high performance, open-source universal RPC framework. By default it uses Protocol Buffers to define exposed services.

The framework provides features such as bidirectional streaming and has support for many different programming languages.

gRPC was initially developed at Google and is now licensed under Apache 2.0.

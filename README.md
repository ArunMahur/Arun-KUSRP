This Repository contains 2 types of projects, which are as following:-  
(1) GRPC Project in Java using Eclipse and Maven::  
                    (a)grpcDemo  
                    (b)SimpleGrpc  
(2) Test Driven Development Examples(TDD)  
  
    
      
        ** What is gRPC **  
gRPC is a high performance, open-source universal REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL framework. By default it uses Protocol Buffers to define exposed services.
The framework provides features such as bidirectional streaming and has support for many different programming languages.
gRPC was initially developed at Google and is now licensed under Apache 2.0.  
  
  In gRPC, 'g' does not stand for google, it's just an recursive.For the transport layer it use http2 which help to take advantage of streaming.For this rpc project we can use the services of streaming from server to client or client to server.
  For the binary level packages they are using protocol buffers.
